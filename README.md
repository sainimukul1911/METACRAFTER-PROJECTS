## About the Project
This is a repository dedicated to Metacrafters Projects. Our task was to build an NFT with mint mechanism, list mechanism and Total Supply Mechanism.

## Methodology
In the project I have made three main functions. Those are mintNFT, listNFTs and getTotalSupply. The NFTs are related to animes. In the runtime, I have depicted adding these NFTs
```javascript
mintNFT("GOKU",1000,"white")
mintNFT("DORAEMON",100,"blue")
mintNFT("SHINCHAN",10,"brown")
getTotalSupply()
listNFTs()
```

## Thanks!
